<h1 align="center">Memory Card</h1>

<p align="center">I developed this React app as part of [The Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript/lessons/memory-card) Fullstack curriculum. This project was another milestone for me, as this project was developed with React Hooks/Functional Components.</p>

<p align="center">Developed a card based Memory game, where players click on a card in an array, and attempt to remember which ones they have already selected. When the player clicks a card that they have already clicked previously, the game ends, with an option to play again. The game tracks their current game's score, as well as the player's High Score.
