# Memory-Card

This is my implementation of The Odin Project's Memory Card project.

I developed this React app as part of [The Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript/lessons/memory-card) Fullstack curriculum. This project will be another important milestone for me, as this project will be developed from the start with Hooks/Functional Components, as opposed to being refactored with them later.

# Tech/framework used

This project utilized: HTML/CSS | React | React Hooks | Git

# Features

Developed a card based Memory game, where players click on a card in an array, and attempt to remember which ones they have already selected. When the player clicks a card that they have already clicked previously, the game ends, with an option to play again. The game tracks their current game's score, as well as the player's High Score.
