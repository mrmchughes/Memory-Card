<h1>Memory Card</h1>

I developed this React app as part of The Odin Project's Fullstack [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-memory-card).
This project was another milestone for me, as it was developed with React Hooks/Functional Components.

I developed a Card Memory game, where players click on a card in an array, and attempt to remember which ones they have already selected. When the player clicks a card that they have already clicked previously, the game ends, with a new game immediately starting. The game tracks the current game's score, as well as the player's High Score.
